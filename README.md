# Brick-Buster-Game
Brick-Buster Game Development using Vanilla JavaScript and HTML5 Canvas

Here is the implementation of a simple brick game. Here is how simple brick game works. You have layers
of colored bricks and a tossed up ball with which to break the layers. Controlling the momentum
of the ball (usually a red ball) is a paddle which you have to maneuver from side to side.
When the ball is bounced up by the paddle, it will hit a brick and then the brick is gone. After
that the ball will come down, if the paddle misses the ball, game is over.
